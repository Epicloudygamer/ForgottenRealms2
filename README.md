## Level Design
This is the world for Forgotten Realms. The world has four levels. The hub is the beginning level of the game where you spawn in. The Valley is also considered part of level one where you get used to the main game mechanics. Level 2 is The Tower where the game difficulty increases slightly. Level 3 is the cave, which is a very difficult level. Level 4 is the final level which is the Sky Island where the final boss lives.
